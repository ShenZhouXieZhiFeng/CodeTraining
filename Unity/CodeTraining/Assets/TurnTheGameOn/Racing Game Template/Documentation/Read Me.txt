• Please load the garage scene once to generate player data before trying to directly load any other scene.

• Select "Window/RGT Settings" to open the "Racing Game Template Project Editor Window", many common project settings can be chamged here.

• Preconfigured scenes have been added for you to customize by editing the environment and waypoints to create your own racing game. Duplicate a race scene and set up a new  track and way-point path using the manager.

• Multiplayer Services: Select Window/Services, then select multiplayer and click the link to go to dashboard. This will take you to a Unity web page to configure multiplayer services for your project.

• If testing demo scenes on mobile or web devices you can replace the race track prefab in each scene with the mobile track prefab for better performance. Track prefabs are located in Assets\TurnTheGameOn\Racing Game Template\Prefabs

• Follow the video overviews which provides detailed step by step insight into how the project works.

• Graphics in the demo scenes use the Post Processing Stack which is available on the asset store : https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912

///////////// Race Scene
///
Data is loaded into this scene from the garage scene through scriptable objects and playerprefs.

\\Waypoints - Waypoints are used by the players arrow waypointer, AI vehicles, and position system. Waypoints must be configured throughout the track to ensure proper position tracking and AI movement.

- Configure Mode: This is a lock that only allows waypoints to be automatically adjusted based on current settings when turned on. The waypoint system is very powerful but easy to misuse if not properly understood. Always save your scene before adjusting this setting as it will delete objects and manager references. When you need to reduce the total waypoint size you should turn off configure mode, adjust total waypoints value, then turn on configure mode to have the inspector auto update and assign new values to the waypoints, then click the cleanup old waypoints button to remove and organize any points not accounted for from your scene.

- Total Waypoints: Automatically adds/removes/adjust waypoints in the scene to be used for position tracking, Ai and the player arrow waypointer.

\\Settings
- Ready Time: Set the amount of timer will count down before the race begins.

- Spawn Points: A reference to each vehicles spawn point. Tip you can move these to any position/rotation in the scene you want.

\\Info
- Manager Reference: A reference to all prefabs and components used by the race scene.


/////////////Open World Scene
This is a simple open world scene that loads the players currently selected vehicle to test drive.



/////////////CARS
To add new car models you need to replace the models in the car prefabs with your own, this really as easy as just replacing the models, adjusting the colliders on the prefab, including the wheel colliders to make sure everything is scaled properly. While you’re at it you can adjust each vehicles inspector settings to tweak the performance of the cars; many variables are exposed in the inspector, spend some time playing with the settings and tweak your cars to perfection.


/////////////RACES
To add new races to the kit you must create the new tracks, adjust the Racing Game Template Project Editor, configure the new race scenes and add the scenes to your build settings. 

In your race scenes, adjust your waypoints and starting points in the scene. Use the Race Manager to set the amount of waypoints you require for your track and position them along your course, test drive your course to ensure waypoint placements are as optimal as they can be. Follow the advice outlined in the documentation above or use the video tutorial for a visual overview of this process.



<>PlayerPrefs
All playerprefs calls are made through the static RGT_PlayerPrefs.cs script, use this as a starting point if you would like to save data using another method.
