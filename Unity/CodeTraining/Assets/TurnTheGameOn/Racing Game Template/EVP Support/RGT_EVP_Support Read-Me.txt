EVP RGT Integration Guide

RGT includes a support package for users who would like to use EVP as an alternative to the included physics system. This may be considered if you have previously configured EVP vehicles, and would like to use those vehicles instead. The default camera and car prefabs from EVP are used as a reference, these will be used in place of the included camera and car prefabs.

If you don't have EVP it's recommended that you start with the included physics as they will more than meet the needs of most developers who use RGT.

The support package includes a custom AIHelper script that proveds basic AI pathfinding along RGT waypoint routes as well as an RGT_EVPSupport script that will allow the spawned EVP prefab interface with the supported RGT components. Basic player and opponent prefabs are pre-configured. Details on how to modify your existing prefab are outlined as well in this file. 

The included EVP example prefabs have not been configured for optimial gameplay, they are close to their default configuration.

Please keep in mind some of the features of RGT are dependant on using the default controller, if these settings or features are not available in EVP they can't be supported, if a similar feature is available it will be used instead; examples include: ---Gears are not supported, no UI display, no IK Driver shifting ---RPMs are not supported, Throttle Input is used as a substitute for UI display. There are more, but I will work to improve the default feature set of the EVP support package through updates.

Note: After importing the EVP Support package, required scripts will added and/or updated to use EVP instead of the default physics scripts. Example vehicle prefabs will also be imported to the EVP Support folder, use these as a starting point for EVP vehicle prefabs or use these as a reference to help configure your own prefabs; these prefabs are assigned in the RGT Settings (Open from Unity Toolbar Window/RGT Settings) as Player and Opponent Vehicles, you can replace them with your own.
